Dear Dr. Timmes,


We have revised our manuscript in accordance with the comments of our referee. Those revisions are marked in red (using \textcolor in the LaTex), and often followed by a note (using \authorcomment2) at the end of the revised paragraph. We've added line numbers to aid in locating some revisions. 



Response to the referee comments:

1. We agree that the exponential fit is no better the power-law model in most tests, except it does appear to do better in matching the reconstructed delay-time measures without having to invoke different power-law fits for clustered and field environments. We have also add a brief discussion on the comparison of the Herringer et al. 2019 result, which we comment on in the response to comment #9.

2. We do a more thorough job of addressing other plausible SN Ia models, including sub-Chandrasekhar scenarios, in section 2.1, as highlighted. The main point, as written in the revision, is that these other scenarios do not match well the observed characteristics of most SNe Ia, and therefore not likely the dominant channels for SN Ia production. 

3. We do a more thorough job of discussing the error in the bounds of the fraction of the IMF responsible for SNe Ia (k) in section 2.1. The paragraph on the lower limit has been corrected. A pair of WD drawn from the Catalan WD distribution should be, on average, around 0.7 M_sun, not 0.6 M_sun as previously stated. The MIST-bast IFMRs from Cummings puts these at ZAMS mass of around 3 M_sun, but no less than 2 M_sun. On the upper limit we now note, in addition to the mass limit for C ignition, the paucity of CO WDs above 8 M_sun. 

As we also now indicate, our fits for the efficiency fraction (in the mass range) that are ultimately successful in making SNe Ia effectively carry with it the uncertainties in k (and the hubble constant, for that matter). Those uncertainties in fit are significantly lower than the systematic uncertainties in k.

4. We agree with the referees comment, and added the suggested phasing to the paragraph in section 2.1.

5. We assume that the uncertainties for all published volumetric rate measurements are gaussian in nature, but may be underestimated by some factor that scales with the value of the observed rates. This is motivated by the fact that we are using just the statistical error reported for each rate value, and plausible sources of systematic uncertainty (such as classification errors and misestimated detected efficiencies) will tend to increase as the observed rate increase, and vice-versa. The factor f is a free parameter that accounts for the underestimation of uncertainties described above. By allowing just a single f value applied to all rates measurements at all redshifts, we are effectively asserting that the scale of systematic errors is similarly related to the rate values in all surveys. Although certainly not precisely correct, that should be an acceptable assumption at least to first order. We clarify this in Section 2.3.

6. The goal of this study is more about model fitting than precise parameter estimation. We focused on a proxy function that has the flexibility to encompass the range in real delay-time distributions from binary synthesis models. We add this note to section 2.5.

7. Our previous presentation of KS test was incorrect. The goal of that test and figure was to show that the properties of SN hosts span the same range of characteristics as the other galaxies in the catalog, and not biased to some extrema or non-representative regime. We have replaced Figure 7 with a new diagram we feel illustrates this point more effectively, and revised the text of section 3 accordingly.

8. Following this recommendation, we include epsilon as a free parameter in the SFH MCMC, rather than fixing it at the CSFH MCMC median value. The resultant epsilon = 0.056 +15% -12% is consistent with 0.06, as was expected. This revision is shown at the end of section 3, and throughout the paper.


9. We have added the results of Herringer+19 for sSFR-CL based determination of the delay-time distribution power-law slope, in figure 9 and the accompanying text. We note that while those results were determined from a sample of field galaxies in SDSS, the derived relation is significantly higher than the reconstructed DTD values for field galaxies from Maoz et al. and elsewhere. The discrepancy is interesting, and perhaps important to the effectiveness of color-SFR relation, but resolving it is a bit beyond the scope of our study. Additionally, it is still fair to say that this exponential-like model from our analysis represents the DTD values well, and has the added benefit of not requiring different fits in different environments to explain the data, as stated. This is evidenced by the reduced chi2 values presented in section 4. Nonetheless, we have removed the "... if not better"  part of the sentence at line 268. We also note that our model is simply plotted onto figure 9--  no scaling was made to align the model with the DTD values.

10. We have corrected the measurements from Mannucci et al., Sullivan et al., and Smith et al. in the lowest sSFR bin so as they are not upper limits. We have also revised the text around line 295 accordingly.
